# The Problem

I've recently come across some folks who want to hold onto bitcoin for the long haul.  The question on all of our
minds is how to hold onto bitcoin cheaply, simply and securely.  Everyone has their own ideas on this, but I've
put together some instructions that make sense to me and my colleagues.

## What's Wrong with Coinbase?

Most of us start out at [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) since it's a great
company, with [great engineers](http://www.craighammell.com/) and they claim
to take some [serious security measures](https://coinbase.com/security).  The
problem is that Coinbase is at best as secure as a non-FDIC-insured bank, and
maybe less secure.  Meaning, like banks they are susceptible to physical
burglaries, and, though we shudder to think of it, personal extortion of key
employees.  Unlike banks, they are not FDIC-insured, so your deposits are not
protected from a "run on the bank" or the sudden failure of their business.
One of the coolest parts of bitcoin is that it allows you to take your security
into your own hands.  Why not grab this opportunity by the balls (bits)?
